    <p>Won't you celebrate with me<br>
        What i have shaped into<br>
        A kind of life? i had no model.<br>
        born in babaylon<br>
        both nonwhite and women<br>
        what did i see to be except myself?
    </p>
    <p>
        I made it up<br>
        here on this bridge between<br>
        starshine and clay<br>
        my one hand holding tight<br>
        my other hand;come celebrate<br>
        with me that everyday<br>
        something has tried to kill me<br>
        and has failed.<br>
